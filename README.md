# pavilion-comments

Welcome to **pavilion-comments**, the discussion system for [Celestial Pavilion](https://celestial-pavilion.com)! 🌙✨

We use **Giscus**, a GitHub-powered commenting system, to allow discussions on our blog posts. This keeps conversations **clean, spam-free, and fully transparent**.

## ❓ How Do Comments Work?

1. **Sign in with GitHub** – To leave a comment, you’ll need a **GitHub account**. If you don’t have one, you can [sign up for free](https://github.com/join).  
   
2. **Navigate to a blog post** – Scroll to the bottom where the **comment section** appears.

3. **Leave a comment** – Once signed in, type your thoughts and submit! 🎉 Your comment will be **publicly visible**.

4. **Discussions are stored on GitHub** – Instead of being stored on Celestial Pavilion, comments become part of a **GitHub Discussion thread**, ensuring better moderation and security.
